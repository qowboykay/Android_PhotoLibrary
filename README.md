# Android Photo Library App

I recently developed an Android application that serves as a photo library, adapted from my previous JavaFX Photo Library desktop application. This mobile app offers a personalized, user-friendly experience for managing and browsing through digital photo albums. I've ensured that the core functionalities of my previous project are retained and optimized for Android, making it more accessible and convenient for users on their smartphones.

## Features
### Home Screen
Album Management: The app opens with a home screen displaying all albums saved from previous sessions. Users can effortlessly create, delete, and rename albums. Opening an album reveals all its photos in thumbnail format.<br>
### Photo Management within Albums
Adding and Removing Photos: Users can add new photos to an album or remove existing ones.<br>
Slideshow Display: There's a photo display mode with a slideshow feature. Users can navigate through the album's photos one at a time, either forward or backward, using manual controls.<br>
Tagging System: Photos can be tagged with 'person' or 'location' tags. Users can add or delete these tags as needed. Tags are visible when a photo is displayed.<br>
### Photo Movement and Search Functionality
Moving Photos: Users can move photos from one album to another.<br>
Advanced Search: The app supports searching for photos across all albums by tag-value pairs (limited to 'person' and 'location'). Searches are case-insensitive and feature auto-completion for ease of use. For instance, typing "New" might suggest "New York," "New Mexico," etc. Both conjunction and disjunction searches are implemented.<br>
### Additional Notes
User Experience: Designed for single-user use on a personal smartphone, the app doesn't require user login or admin functionalities.<br>
Simplifications: Explicit captions and dates for photos aren't required; filenames are used as captions.<br>
Photo Storage: The application allows saving photos to the device's gallery.<br>
